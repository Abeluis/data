# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Assignment
 
Hi, this is my assignment for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course.

My code uses mostly **dplyr** and **tidyverse** to perform the tasks needed to complete it, the readability is improved thanks to the pipes that operate as a chain to work with the data, this replaces the function and data approach or the R base syntaxes that is quite confusing.  I also used **pacman** because is a easy way to load packages to an R script in a new environment or project. 

Finally, I translated some of the variable names and values to Spanish to make it easier to read for me.
